Load Balancers

Sticky Session - even if you visit a website multiple times you still end up with the same session object i.e same backend server
- stored in shared storage - MySQL, NFS
- Cookies - not just the backend servers but the load could also insert cookies

Software: HAProxy (open source - also used in Flipkart), ELB (AWS), LVS
Hardware: Cisco, Citrix

DNS lookups
- cached by OS and browser as well
- can result in one server getting overloaded (if load balancing achieved via simple DNS entries for each server)

Caching
- html files instead of regenerating them very time via web server
- mysql query cache
- memcached (used by Facebook) - in memory (RAM) cache - can be run same server or different

MySQL storage engines - InnoDB, MyISAM - the way in which the underlying data is stored
InnoDB(locks - row) supports transactions as compared to MyISAM (locks - full table)

Replication:
1. Master-Slave setup
Good for read heavy applications - example facebook during its initial days
That is, can redirect read queries to the slaves and horizontally scale slaves - load balancing read requests
Single point of failure for writes as it will take some time to promote a slave as master

2. Master-Master setup
2 master syncing between themselves

Now, the load balancer can be a single point of failure.
Normally, 2 load balancers - active-active setup/active-passive setup
Send hearbeats to each other - if active one goes down, passive takes its ip address and becomes active.

Partitioning:
Example, users with names starting from A-M - some set of servers and N-Z - other set of servers

High Availability
Example, Master-Master setup

Availability Zone: Regions
Distribute loads across data centres? DNS level load balancing or geography based load balancing
Now if the ip address of the load balancer at a particular data centre is cached and if the data centre itself goes down then
it may take some time for the ttl of the session/cookie to expire

Allow - tcp:80 (http), 443 (https), 22 (ssh)
It is common to offload the encryption/SSL (also called SSL termination) till the load balancer and then further use decrypted data
No need install SSL certificates in each of the servers in the topology.
Can use higher end servers for load balancers for doing the decryption and cheaper servers further down the topology.

Mysql uses tcp:3306 port number by default for queries.

Principle of least privileges - only open the doors that people actually have to go throw. Otherwise you are inviting unexpected behaviour.
So someone might take advantage of that.
